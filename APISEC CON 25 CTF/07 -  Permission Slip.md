A company has exposed their API documentation through an OpenAPI specification. Most endpoints require authentication, but there might be a misconfiguration where an endpoint that should require authentication doesn't actually enforce it.

Your task is to:

1. Analyze the OpenAPI specification  
2. Find the endpoint that doesn't properly enforce authentication  
3. Extract the flag from the vulnerable endpoint

For this challenge, I downloaded the API's Swagger file and imported it into Postman.

In Postman, I changed the value of the "baseUrl" variable to the application site.

After that, I added a script to test if a GET request to an endpoint returned status 200. This way, I could verify which endpoint returns a positive response without needing a token.

```
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

With that in place, I just selected the collection and ran the script for all endpoints.

In this case, it didnâ€™t work very well, as almost all requests returned a 200 status code with the same content:

However, by analyzing the responses, I noticed that one of them returned something different. The endpoint `/api/v1/it/servers/status` returned other information, including the flag.

```json
flag{0p3n_4p1_vuln3r4b1l1ty_1ntr0}

For this challenge, I followed the tip from the description and used the APIsec platform to scan the application by uploading the Swagger specification.

I found a critical alert in the endpoint `/api/v3/finance/check/version`, and it contained the flag.

```json
flag{0p3n_4p1_sp3c_vuln3r4b1l1ty}
